# Game Of Life

In this interactive simulation, you'll witness the dynamic behavior of various objects as they move, grow, and strive to survive. Unlike traditional games, you won't be controlling the action here; the game unfolds autonomously.

## About Game Objects

1. **Grass (color - green)**: It simply grows in empty areas.

2. **GrassEater (color - yellow)**: It scans its surroundings and eats grass when it sees it. If there's nothing to eat, it moves around.

3. **Predator (color - blue)**: It scans its surroundings and preys on GrassEaters when it sees them. If there's no prey, it roams.

4. **Bomb (color - black)**: It doesn't move and, after a moment, detonates. Upon detonation, it creates grass in the affected area.

5. **Fire (color - Flame Orange)**: It burns everything in its path, but in winter, they all die.

Please note that this is a simplified overview. If you have specific questions or need more information about the code, feel free to ask!
