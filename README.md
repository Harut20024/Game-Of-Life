## About Game Objects 
1. Grass(color - green) - It simply grows in empty areas.
2. GrassEater(color - yellow) - It scans its surroundings and eats grass when it sees it. If there's nothing to eat, it moves around.
3. Predator(color - blue) - It scans its surroundings and preys on GrassEaters when it sees them. If there's no prey, it roams.
4. Bomb(color - black) - It doesn't move and, after a moment, detonates. Upon detonation, it creates grass in the affected area.
